Q1. How did changing values on the SparkSession property parameters affect the throughput and latency of the data?

One of the most interesting parameters that I tried was "writeAheadLog.enable". This made the throughput slower but
if we were running this for a production environment it will nice to have as it will keep a transction log in case of failures.


2. What were the 2-3 most efficient SparkSession property key/value pairs? 
   Through testing multiple variations on values, how can you tell these were the most optimal?

maxRatePerPartition : 100 -> I started with "2" and I saw it execution really slow, upping it to 100 improve the throughput.
minRatePerPartition : 5 -> Its default value is 1, I tried increasing it and I can see a lower latency.
